This Bot will allow you to automatically send a message to first connections on LinkedIn.

You will need to modify a couple of things in code before sending a message:

    #*************** STEP 1 **************** 
    input a session_username and session_password which correspond to your LinkedIn username and password;
    
    #*************** STEP 2 ****************
    input the url link to your first connections page in LinkedIn;
        - enter nothing in the search field and press enter;
        - Click the "People" button;
        - Click the "Connect" button;
        - Select the "First Connections" option.
        -Copy the URL link


    You will see comments with the above annotation in the code which denotes the STEP where you want to input your custom parameters.

    Keep in mind that 
    LinkedIn will automatically block you for spamming if you do it for too long.
    so reserve it for short periods of time.

    
    Only 10 messages in a go, give break for every 10 messages.
    And don't send more than 50 messages in a day.
    
    
    Happy Hacking.   :wink :wink
